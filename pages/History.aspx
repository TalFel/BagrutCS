            <h1 class="smallheader">1998 - 2009 The pre-Bitcoin years</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Although Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts at creating online currencies with ledgers secured by encryption.
                Two examples of these were B-Money and Bit Gold, which were formulated but never fully developed.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2008 Mr. Nakamoto</h1>
            <p class="text">
                A paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a mailing list discussion on cryptography.
                It was posted by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains a mystery to this day.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2008 Bitcoin begins</h1>
            <p class="text">
                The Bitcoin software is made available to the public for the first time and mining begins. It's told that Mr. Nakamoto started mining on his own laptop to start
                Bitcoin.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2010 Bitcoin is valued for the first time</h1>
            <p class="text">
                As it had never been traded, only mined, it was impossible to assign a monetary value to the units of the emerging cryptocurrency.
                In 2010, someone decided to sell theirs for the first time – swapping 10,000 of them for two pizzas.
                If the buyer had hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than $100 million.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2011 Rival cryptocurrencies emerge</h1>
            <p class="text">
                As Bitcoin increases in popularity and the idea of decentralized and encrypted currencies catch on, the first alternative cryptocurrencies appear.
                These are sometimes known as altcoin and generally try to improve on the original Bitcoin design by offering greater speed, anonymity or some other advantage.
                Among the first to emerge were Namecoin and Litecoin. Currently there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation with new ones frequently appearing.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2013 Bitcoin price crashes</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Shortly after the price of one Bitcoin reaches $1,000 for the first time, the price quickly begins to decline.
                Many who invested money at this point will have suffered losses as the price plummeted to around $300 – it would be more than two years before it reached $1,000 again.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2014 Scams and theft</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Perhaps unsurprisingly for a currency designed with anonymity and lack of control in mind, Bitcoin has proven to be an attractive and lucrative target for criminals.
                In January 2014, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox went offline, and the owners of 850,000Bitcoins never saw them again.
                Investigations are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened but whatever the story, someone dishonestly got their hands on a haul which at the time was valued at $450 million dollars.
                At today’s prices, those missing coins would be worth $4.4 billion.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2016 Ethereum and ICOs</h1>
            <p class="text">
                One cryptocurrency came close to stealing Bitcoin’s thunder this year, as enthusiasm grew around the Ethereum platform. This platform uses cryptocurrency known as Ether to facilitate blockchain-based smart contracts and apps.
                Ethereum’s arrival was marked by the emergence of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These are fundraising platforms which offer investors the chance to trade what are often essentially stocks or shares in startup ventures,
                in the same manner that they can invest and trade cryptocurrencies. In the US the SEC warned investors that due to the lack of oversight ICOs could easily be scams or ponzi schemes disguised as legitimate investments.
                The Chinese government went one further, by banning them outright.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2017 Bitcoin reaches $10,000 and continues to grow</h1>
            <p class="text">
                A gradual increase in the places where Bitcoin could be spent contributed to its continued growth in popularity, during a period where it’s value remained below previous peaks. Gradually as more and more uses emerged,
                it became clear that more money was flowing into the Bitcoin and cryptocoin ecosystem. During this period the market cap of all cryptocoins rose from $11bn to its current height of over $300bn. Banks including Barclays, Citi Bank,
                Deutsche Bankand BNP Paribas have said they are investigating ways they might be able to work with Bitcoin. Meanwhile the technology behind Bitcoin – blockchain – has sparked a revolution in the fintech industry (and beyond) which is only just getting started.
            </p>
            <h1 class="smallheader">2020-2021 The Cryptocurrency golden years</h1>
            <p class="text">
                at March 16th 2020 Bitcoin started growing, but like no other growth we saw yet. its value was aprox. 5000 and in the next 1.5 years (and hopefully more) it skyrokketed, it has gained more than 1000% on value
                and surly, the whole world knows about it now. but not only bitcoin value stated climbing, also all of its comptetitors. from a market cap of 150 billion dollars to a market cap of almost 3000 billion dollars.
                Ethereum, the main Bitcoin comptetitor right now has grown from 110$ to 4800$ a few days ago (8/11/21) - more than 4300% growth on value.
                these two years were amazing for the major investors in this technolegy and also to the few lucky ones that got rich by an accident.
